Olist E-commerce Analytics

Overview

This project explores the Olist e-commerce dataset using PostgreSQL and Power BI.

The goal was to move beyond basic dashboards and build structured analytical views that answer real business questions around revenue, customer behavior, product performance, and seller impact.

All transformations and aggregations were handled in SQL using clean, reusable views. Power BI was used for visualization and reporting.

Business Questions Explored

How is revenue trending month over month?

Which product categories generate the most sales and profit?

How do different states contribute to overall performance?

Who are the top-performing sellers?

How are customers segmented based on spending behavior?

What does customer retention look like across categories?

Technical Approach

PostgreSQL for data modeling and analytical views

SQL features used:

CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, ranking logic)

Aggregations and grouping

Date transformations

Customer segmentation logic

Power BI for dashboard development and reporting

The focus was on building consistent, structured views that separate data logic from visualization
